This is a visualizer based on the mozilla voice-change-o-matic
http://mdn.github.io/voice-change-o-matic/

The visualizer should be a full screen projection that works in any modern browser.

Current stage is just a (slightly worse) copy of the original, because I wanted to reverse engineer it a bit.

Currently the visualizer is on fullscreen, the options are accessible with the up and down arrows.

Mute works with a delay. Think its something to do with buffer, checking it with next iteration.
Has buggy mute unmute toggle.

TODO:

-improved UI (top center Mozilla mic icon might be a problem)

-new visualizer modes

-try to enable convolver

-need wider input range for possible guitar input via mic

-custom module config? (pick from list?)

This is a pet project so any comments and suggestions are welcome :]
