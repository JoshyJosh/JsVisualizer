This is a visualizer based on the mozilla voice-change-o-matic
http://mdn.github.io/voice-change-o-matic/

The visualizer should be a full screen projection that currently fully works in Firefox only.
Chrome users need to run chrome with "--allow-file-access-from-files" or on a local server if they want to use the files localy. An online version will be prepared for such users.

Current stage is just a (slightly worse) copy of the original, because I wanted to reverse engineer it a bit.

Toggle fullscreen with "F" (instruction also under the visualizer options).

TODO:

-improved UI (top center Mozilla mic icon might be a problem)

-new visualizer modes

-try to enable convolver

-need wider input range for possible guitar input via mic

-custom module config? (pick from list?)

This is a pet project so any comments and suggestions are welcome :]
